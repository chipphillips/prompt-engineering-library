# Influencer Collaborations & UGC

Prompts for influencer partnerships and user-generated content campaigns.


```markdown
## 1. Media Type & Definition
**Influencer Collaborations & User-Generated Content**  
Influencer collaborations involve partnering with social media personalities or industry leaders to create branded content. User-generated content (UGC) includes images, videos, reviews, or testimonials voluntarily created by a brand’s audience.

---

## 2. Strategic Context
- **Social Proof**: Consumers trust content from peers or influencers more than direct brand ads.
- **Expanded Reach**: Influencers introduce brands to new audiences, increasing brand awareness.
- **Authentic Engagement**: UGC fosters a sense of community and ownership among customers.
- **Cost-Effective Content**: UGC can supplement brand-created media with minimal production overhead.
