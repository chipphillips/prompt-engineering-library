# Microsites & Campaign Portals

Prompts for creating targeted microsites and campaign-specific web portals.

---

## 1. Media Type & Definition
**Microsites & Campaign Portals**  
Microsites are small, standalone websites focusing on a specific campaign, product, or brand initiative. Campaign portals similarly serve as centralized hubs for marketing activities, resources, and user interaction tied to a particular promotion or event.

---

## 2. Strategic Context
- **Focused Branding**: Microsites can have unique branding separate from the main corporate identity if needed.
- **Experimentation**: Allows testing of new design concepts or messaging without affecting the main site.
- **Targeted Engagement**: Visitors to a campaign portal are often highly interested in that particular offer or event.
- **Lead Acquisition & Nurturing**: A dedicated portal can host interactive tools, content, and sign-up forms.
